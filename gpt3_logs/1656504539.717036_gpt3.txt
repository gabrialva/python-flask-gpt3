PROMPT:

Song for a dying cat: 

==========

RESPONSE:

I purr for you now in your final moments
I knead my paws against your fur
My love for you was strong and true
Even though we only met a short while ago

Please know that I'll always remember
The moments we spent together
Even as you take your final breath
I'll be right here with you, until the end
